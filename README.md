# AWS Migration Services and Supported Migration Types

## Migration Strategies (7 Rs)

1. **Rehost (Lift & Shift)**
   - Moving applications to AWS without making changes
   - Fastest migration approach with minimal modifications
   - Tools: AWS Application Migration Service (MGN), AWS Server Migration Service (SMS), AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery

2. **Replatform (Lift & Reshape)**
   - Making targeted optimizations during migration
   - Keeping core architecture but leveraging cloud capabilities
   - Tools: AWS Database Migration Service (DMS), AWS DataSync, AWS Transfer Family

3. **Refactor/Re-architect**
   - Reimagining how the application is architected using cloud-native features
   - Highest long-term benefit but requires more effort
   - Tools: AWS Database Migration Service (with Schema Conversion), AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations

4. **Repurchase (Drop & Shop)**
   - Moving to a different product, typically SaaS
   - Example: Moving from self-hosted CRM to Salesforce
   - Tools: AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations (for SaaS recommendations)

5. **Retire**
   - Identifying applications that are no longer needed and can be turned off
   - Tools: AWS Application Discovery Service, AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations

6. **Retain (Hybrid)**
   - Keeping certain applications on-premises
   - Common for applications that require major refactoring or will be replaced soon
   - Tools: AWS DataSync, AWS Transfer Family (for hybrid scenarios)

7. **Relocate**
   - Moving infrastructure to the cloud without purchasing new hardware, rewriting applications, or modifying existing operations
   - Example: VMware Cloud on AWS, which allows moving VMware workloads to AWS without changes
   - Tools: VMware Cloud on AWS, AWS Outposts

## AWS Migration Services in Detail

### AWS Migration Hub
- **Purpose**: Central dashboard to track migration progress
- **Features**: 
  - Single console to track migrations across multiple AWS tools
  - Integration with other AWS migration services
  - Migration status tracking and visualization

### AWS Application Discovery Service
- **Purpose**: Discover and analyze on-premises workloads
- **Features**:
  - Agentless discovery via VMware vCenter
  - Agent-based discovery for detailed information
  - Data collection about server configurations, performance, and dependencies

### AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations
- **Purpose**: Recommend migration and modernization strategies
- **Features**:
  - Analyze application components and dependencies
  - Provide right-sizing recommendations
  - Suggest optimal migration strategies (which of the 7 Rs)

### AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
- **Purpose**: Migrate databases to AWS with minimal downtime
- **Features**:
  - Homogeneous migrations (same database engine)
  - Heterogeneous migrations (different database engines) with Schema Conversion Tool
  - Continuous Data Replication (CDC) for minimal downtime

### AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)
- **Purpose**: Primary service for lift-and-shift migrations
- **Features**:
  - Formerly CloudEndure Migration
  - Block-level replication for minimal downtime
  - Automated machine conversion for AWS compatibility

### AWS DataSync
- **Purpose**: Transfer file data between on-premises and AWS
- **Features**:
  - High-speed data transfer
  - Built-in encryption and data validation
  - Support for NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3, EFS, FSx

### AWS Transfer Family
- **Purpose**: Transfer files using FTP/SFTP/FTPS protocols
- **Features**:
  - Fully managed FTP service
  - Integration with existing authentication systems
  - Store and access data in S3 or EFS

### AWS Snow Family
- **Purpose**: Large-scale data transfer for limited connectivity scenarios
- **Features**:
  - Snowcone: Small, rugged, portable computing device
  - Snowball: Petabyte-scale data transport
  - Snowmobile: Exabyte-scale data transfer service

### AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (formerly CloudEndure Disaster Recovery)
- **Purpose**: Disaster recovery and migration
- **Features**:
  - Continuous block-level replication
  - Point-in-time recovery
  - Automated machine conversion

## Migration Workflow

1. **Discover**: Use AWS Application Discovery Service to inventory and analyze your environment
2. **Plan**: Use AWS Migration Hub Strategy Recommendations to determine migration strategies
3. **Migrate**: Use appropriate migration tools based on workload type
4. **Modernize**: Optimize applications after migration for cloud-native benefits

## Best Practices

1. **Start with assessment**: Understand your current environment before migration
2. **Prioritize applications**: Begin with less complex, non-critical applications
3. **Consider dependencies**: Map application dependencies to avoid disruptions
4. **Test thoroughly**: Validate migrations in a test environment before cutover
5. **Plan for rollback**: Have a contingency plan if migration issues occur
6. **Monitor post-migration**: Ensure performance and functionality after migration
